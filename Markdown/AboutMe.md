Hi, welcome to my webpage. My name is Frank, I am postdoctoral researcher in evolutionary robotics that aims to investigate
principles of evolution in artificial systems. I am interested in how life arose,
and how this knowledge can be used as a tool to create artificial systems.
For this goal, I like to envision life evolving in the early stages of evolution
and how processes influenced evolving organisms to become the amazingly complex
organisms that we see today.

I focus on investigating how control systems, morphogenesis and evolutionary computation can
    be combined to give rise to virtual creatures and even robots. Will we be able to learn
    any essential evolutionary principles or developmental strategies from these models?
    Will these models ultimately be able to inform us on how to design artificial systems?

Apart from research, I am a game design enthusiast where I love procedural game design,
    physics-based simulations, programming shaders, 3D-modeling, animations and designing
    music for games. I also enjoy understanding scientific methods through simulating and
    illustrating them in the Unity game engine.
